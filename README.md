A major patch for the original Splinter Cell, fixing bugs and adding gameplay improvements.

For a full list of patch notes, refer to the [Patch Notes](PatchNotes.md) page.

## Installation
The latest version of Enhanced SC can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/releases) page. Please note that saves from Enhanced SC are not compatible with the original version of the game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enhanced SC requires the base game to be installed. This patch overwrites original files, so uninstalling is not possible at the moment. Be sure to back up your game beforehand, or be prepared to reinstall it if needed.

### Game Setup
- After downloading Enhanced SC, extract the contents to your Splinter Cell directory and overwrite all existing files when prompted.
- You can adjust additional settings in `Enhanced.ini` located in the System folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Your original saves will not be deleted, but they will appear as missing. Enhanced intentionally hides them because they aren't compatible with this version.
